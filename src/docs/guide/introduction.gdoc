The AWS SDK Plugin allows your "Grails":http://grails.org application to use the "Amazon Web Services":http://aws.amazon.com/ infrastructure services.

The aim is to provide a lightweight @amazonWebService@ Grails service wrapper around the official "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/.

It uses the official "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/, which provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services, making it even easier for developers to build applications that tap into the cost-effective, scalable, and reliable AWS cloud.

Using the SDK, developers can build solutions for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon SimpleDB, and more.

The Grails plugin handles :

* convenient Grails configuration/management of all AWS API java clients for each AWS region,
* easy access to all AWS API java clients through an @amazonWebService@ Grails service wrapper.

h3. Other AWS Grails plugin

FYI, there is another great "AWS Grails plugin":http://grails.org/plugin/aws with a different approach: its aim is to provide an easy "groovy" access to SES (through a groovy DSL) and S3 (through methods injection), based on JetS3 java lib. If you just need basic SES or S3 features, you might give it a try.

We decided to write our own AWS plugin because it did not meet our requirements as we wanted:

# to have a direct access to *ALL* "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/ features, including *ALL* AWS services with custom client configuration,
# to only use "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/ with a consistent way to access *ALL* AWS services (and not JetS3 java lib specific methods and a custom SES DSL),
# fast release update with 100% compatibility with "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/, as it is just a simple lightweight wrapper around the official java clients,
# no need for additional DSL/methods injection, since we found the "AWS SDK for Java":http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/ clients pretty straightforward to use
