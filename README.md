=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agorapulse/grails-aws-sdk.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/agorapulse/grails-aws-sdk)

# Introduction

The [AWS SDK Plugins for Grails3](https://medium.com/@benorama/aws-sdk-plugins-for-grails-3-cc7f910fdc0d#.5gdwdxei3) are a suite of plugins that adds support for the [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) infrastructure services.

The aim is to to get you started quickly by providing friendly lightweight utility [Grails](http://grails.org) service wrappers, around the official [AWS SDK for Java](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/) (which is great but very “java-esque”).
See [this article](https://medium.com/@benorama/aws-sdk-plugins-for-grails-3-cc7f910fdc0d#.5gdwdxei3) for more info.
